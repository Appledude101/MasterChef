All Contracts used injected web-3 through remix. In order to write to the contracts, you will need to use the contract through remix.

Step 1: Go to contract adress below and copy the source code.  
Step 2: Paste source code into file on remix and compile it (make sure you are using correct version of compiler!).  
Step 3: Go to Deploy and Run Trasactions, DO NOT DEPLOY WHAT YOU COMPILED! Instead choose the enviroment to be injected web-3 and then in
the At Address paste the contract address you copied the source code from.  
Now you should see the contract you wanted to interact with under deployed contracts. You can then use the functions on remix to then interact with the contract on the Rinkeby Testnet.
